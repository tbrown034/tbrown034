- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @tbrown034 on github, gmail and other places.
- ðŸ‘€ After nearly two decades of reporting, I recently made a move to become a full-stack web/software engineer. I'm now looking for new opportunites in journalism, tech or preferably something at the intersection of both of those. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: tbrown034@gmail.com.
